Project 4: RU Burger
RU Burger provides menu items, including burgers, sandwiches, beverages, and sides. Your team will develop a
software system with JavaFX to help the burger joint manage the orders. The staff will be the users who use the
software to take the orders, place the orders, and cancel the orders. Customers can customize burgers and sandwiches by choosing the bread types and add-ons.
